Welcome to Flint!

We usually have issues marked as starter issues that are a great easy way in to contributing. 

We truly value your time and contributions. 
We suggest you discuss issues or ideas either on the [FlintCore Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/flintcore/shared_invite/enQtMzUwOTU4NTU0OTYwLWMxYTNiOTNjNmVkOTM3ZDgwNzZiNzJiNmE2NWUyMzUzMjg3ZTg4YjNmMjdhYmZkYTlmYmI2ZDQ5NjU0ZmQ3ZjU) or in a [github issue](https://github.com/MontanaFlossCo/Flint/issues). By talking about things up front we can make sure you don't duplicate work or spend time doing something that is not merged for whatever reason. Please don't make a pull request out of the blue unless it is a trivial obvious mistake. 

If you have any questions about the architecture, ideas or future plans please [get in touch](https://flint.tools/manual/community/).

Right now we're pretty easy on what makes a good pull request or issue. Please just be mindful of the person receiving it; be clear and state the problem concisely, provide all relevant example code or scenarios where possible.

If you are interested in contributing significantly please contact [project lead Marc Palmer](marc@montanafloss.co). There's plenty of cool interesting problems to solve and work to do.
